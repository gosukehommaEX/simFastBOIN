Description: 
    An optimized R implementation of the Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design
    for phase I dose-finding trials. simFastBOIN provides computationally efficient
    functions for pre-computing decision tables, conducting trial simulations, and
    evaluating operating characteristics. The package uses vectorized operations
    and optimized algorithms including C-based PAVA (Pool Adjacent Violators Algorithm)
    for isotonic regression and efficient uniform random number generation for DLT
    simulation to achieve 2-5x faster performance compared to naive implementations
    while maintaining full compatibility with BOIN methodology. Version 1.2.0 introduces
    significant performance optimizations through Iso::pava() integration and optimized
    random number generation. Version 1.1.0 introduced conservative MTD selection
    (boundMTD) and flexible early stopping rules (n_earlystop_rule) to support both
    backward-compatible and BOIN-standard implementations.
