Description: 
    An optimized R implementation of the Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design
    for phase I dose-finding trials. simFastBOIN provides computationally efficient
    functions for pre-computing decision tables, conducting trial simulations, and
    evaluating operating characteristics. The package uses vectorized operations
    to achieve 2-3x faster performance compared to naive implementations while
    maintaining full compatibility with BOIN methodology.
