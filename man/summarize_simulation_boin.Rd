\title{Summarize BOIN Simulation Results}
\usage{
summarize_simulation_boin(simulation_results, n_doses, p_true)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulation_results}{List. Results from \code{simulate_one_trial()}, one element per simulation.
Each element should be a list containing:
\itemize{
\item n_pts: numeric vector of patients at each dose
\item n_tox: numeric vector of DLTs at each dose
\item mtd: numeric value (dose level) or NA
}}

\item{n_doses}{Numeric. Number of doses evaluated in the simulations.}

\item{p_true}{Numeric vector. True toxicity probabilities for each dose.
This is stored in the summary object for display purposes.}
}
\value{
An object of class "boin_summary" (a list) containing:
\item{p_true}{Numeric vector. True toxicity probabilities}
\item{mtd_selection_percent}{Numeric vector (length n_doses + 1). Percentage of trials
selecting each dose as MTD. The last element is the percentage with no MTD selected.}
\item{avg_n_pts}{Numeric vector. Average number of patients treated at each dose}
\item{avg_n_tox}{Numeric vector. Average number of DLTs at each dose}
\item{avg_total_n_pts}{Numeric. Average total patients across all doses}
\item{avg_total_n_tox}{Numeric. Average total DLTs across all doses}
}
\description{
Aggregate results from multiple trial simulations into comprehensive
summary statistics. Uses vectorized operations for efficient computation.
Returns an S3 object of class "boin_summary" which has a custom print method.
}
\details{
This function is typically called after running multiple trial simulations
via \code{sim_boin()}. It computes operating characteristics including MTD
selection rates, patient allocation, and safety metrics.

Operating characteristics are key for evaluating trial design performance
and are presented in trial protocol applications.

The returned object is of class "boin_summary" which has a custom print method.
Simply calling \code{print(result)} or typing \code{result} will display a formatted
summary table.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# This function is typically used internally by sim_boin()
# For demonstration of aggregated results:
target <- 0.30
p_true <- c(0.10, 0.25, 0.40)

result <- sim_boin(
  n_trials = 1000,
  target = target,
  p_true = p_true,
  n_doses = 3,
  n_cohort = 10,
  cohort_size = 3,
  seed = 123
)

# S3 method automatically formats output
print(result$summary)

# Or simply
result$summary

# For knitr::kable format
print(result$summary, kable_output = TRUE)
}
