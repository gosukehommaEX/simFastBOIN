\title{Calculate BOIN Escalation and De-escalation Boundaries}
\usage{
get_boin_boundary(target, p_saf = NULL, p_tox = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{target}{Numeric. The target toxicity probability (e.g., 0.30 for 30\%).
Should be between 0 and 1.}

\item{p_saf}{Numeric. The toxicity probability threshold for safe (subtherapeutic) dose.
Default is 0.6 * target. Doses with observed toxicity rate <= p_saf trigger escalation.}

\item{p_tox}{Numeric. The toxicity probability threshold for overly toxic dose.
Default is 1.4 * target. Doses with observed toxicity rate >= p_tox trigger de-escalation.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{lambda_e}{Numeric. Escalation boundary: toxicity rate threshold for escalation}
\item{lambda_d}{Numeric. De-escalation boundary: toxicity rate threshold for de-escalation}
}
\description{
Compute the escalation and de-escalation boundaries for the Bayesian Optimal
Interval (BOIN) design based on the target toxicity probability. These boundaries
are used to determine dose escalation and de-escalation decisions during the trial.
}
\details{
Based on Bayesian theory with three-point hypothesis, these boundaries are
computed to optimally balance exploration and exploitation in dose finding.
The default values (p_saf = 0.6 * target, p_tox = 1.4 * target) are recommended
and generally yield excellent operating characteristics.

\examples{
# Calculate boundaries for 30\% target toxicity rate
boin_bound <- get_boin_boundary(target = 0.30)
print(boin_bound$lambda_e)
print(boin_bound$lambda_d)

# Calculate boundaries with custom thresholds
boin_bound_custom <- get_boin_boundary(
  target = 0.25,
  p_saf = 0.12,
  p_tox = 0.40
)
