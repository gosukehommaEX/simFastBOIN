\title{Batch MTD Selection for Multiple Trials (Internal)}
\usage{
.select_mtd_batch(
  diffs_mat,
  iso_est_mat,
  eliminated_mat,
  cohorts_completed,
  stop_reason,
  target
)
}
\arguments{
\item{diffs_mat}{Matrix (n_trials x n_doses). Absolute differences between
isotonic estimates and target toxicity rate for each trial.}

\item{iso_est_mat}{Matrix (n_trials x n_doses). Isotonic-adjusted toxicity
rate estimates for each trial.}

\item{eliminated_mat}{Logical matrix (n_trials x n_doses). Whether each dose
has been eliminated in each trial.}

\item{cohorts_completed}{Integer vector (n_trials). Number of cohorts completed
in each trial.}

\item{stop_reason}{Character vector (n_trials). Pre-determined stopping reason
for trials that stopped early (e.g., "lowest_dose_too_toxic").}

\item{target}{Numeric. Target toxicity probability.}
}
\value{
List with two elements:
\item{mtd}{Integer vector (n_trials). Selected MTD for each trial (or NA)}
\item{reason}{Character vector (n_trials). Reason for trial termination}
}
\description{
Select MTD for multiple trials using optimized batch processing. This is an
internal function used by \code{sim_boin()} for efficient MTD selection across
simulation results.
}
\details{
The function first handles trials with pre-determined stopping reasons (e.g.,
safety stopping at lowest dose), then applies vectorized operations to determine
termination reasons for remaining trials, and finally loops over valid trials to
select MTD using the standard BOIN tiebreaker rules.
