\title{Print BOIN Simulation Summary}
\usage{
print_simulation_summary_boin(summary, n_doses, scenario_name = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{summary}{List. Summary statistics from \code{summarize_simulation()}.}

\item{n_doses}{Numeric. Number of doses evaluated.}

\item{scenario_name}{Character. Optional name for the scenario being presented.
If provided, it will be printed as a header.}
}
\value{
No return value. Results are printed to console.
}
\description{
Display formatted simulation results with operating characteristics including
MTD selection rates, patient allocation, and toxicity outcomes.
Designed for easy interpretation in trial protocol documents.
}
\details{
The function prints four main tables:
\enumerate{
\item MTD Selected (\%): Percentage of simulations selecting each dose as MTD
\item Number of Participants Treated (mean): Average enrollment at each dose
\item Number of Participants w/ DLTs (mean): Average toxicity count at each dose
\item \% No MTD Selected (N/S): Percentage of trials without MTD selection
}

These operating characteristics are essential for protocol submissions and
to demonstrate design performance across different dose-toxicity scenarios.
