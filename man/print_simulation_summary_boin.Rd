\title{Print BOIN Simulation Summary}
\usage{
print_simulation_summary_boin(
  summary,
  scenario_name = "",
  kable_output = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{summary}{List. Summary statistics from \code{summarize_simulation_boin()}.}

\item{scenario_name}{Character. Optional name for the scenario being presented.
If provided, it will be printed as a header. Default is "".}

\item{kable_output}{Logical. If TRUE, output tables using knitr::kable() format.
If FALSE (default), output as simple formatted vectors.}
}
\value{
No return value. Results are printed to console.
}
\description{
Display formatted simulation results with operating characteristics including
MTD selection rates, patient allocation, and toxicity outcomes.
Designed for easy interpretation in trial protocol documents.
}
\details{
The function prints four main tables:
\enumerate{
\item MTD Selected (\%): Percentage of simulations selecting each dose as MTD
\item Number of Participants Treated (mean): Average enrollment at each dose
\item Number of Participants w/ DLTs (mean): Average toxicity count at each dose
\item \% No MTD Selected (N/S): Percentage of trials without MTD selection
}

The number of doses is automatically extracted from the summary object,
so explicit specification is not required.

These operating characteristics are essential for protocol submissions and
to demonstrate design performance across different dose-toxicity scenarios.

# After running simulation, display results with default format

# Display results in knitr::kable format

                        scenario_name = "Scenario 1: Base Case",
                        kable_output = TRUE)
