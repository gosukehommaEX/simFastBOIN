\title{Generate Time-to-Event Data for TITE-BOIN Trials}
\usage{
rtite(n, prob, alpha1 = 0.5, alpha2 = 0.5, distribution = "weibull", maxt = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Number of patients to simulate.}

\item{prob}{Numeric. True DLT probability (scalar value between 0 and 1).}

\item{alpha1}{Numeric. Late-onset parameter (0 < alpha1 < 1). Represents the
proportion of toxicity that occurs in the last fraction (alpha2) of the
assessment window. Default is 0.5.}

\item{alpha2}{Numeric. Weibull shape parameter (alpha2 > 0). Defines the
last fraction of the assessment window where alpha1 proportion of toxicity
occurs. Default is 0.5.}

\item{distribution}{Character. Distribution for time-to-toxicity. One of:
\itemize{
\item "weibull": Weibull distribution (default, most commonly used)
\item "log-logistic": Log-logistic distribution
\item "uniform": Uniform distribution (simplest assumption)
}}

\item{maxt}{Numeric. Length of the DLT assessment window (e.g., 28 days).
Toxicities occurring after this time are not considered as DLTs.
Default is 1 (standardized time unit).}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\describe{
\item{tox}{Integer vector. DLT indicator (1 = DLT observed within assessment window,
0 = no DLT or DLT occurred after assessment window)}
\item{t_tox}{Numeric vector. Time to toxicity or censoring. For patients without
DLT within the assessment window, this is set to maxt.}
}
}
\description{
Simulates time-to-event data for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in phase I trials
using time-to-event Bayesian optimal interval (TITE-BOIN) designs.
Supports multiple distributions for modeling the time to toxicity.
}
\details{
The function generates time-to-event data based on the specified distribution:

\strong{Uniform Distribution:}
DLT times are uniformly distributed over \code{[0, maxt]}.

\strong{Weibull Distribution:}
Parameters are calculated such that:
\itemize{
\item The cumulative DLT probability at time maxt equals prob
\item The cumulative DLT probability at time (1 - alpha2) * maxt equals (1 - alpha1) * prob
}

\strong{Log-logistic Distribution:}
Similar parameterization to Weibull, with shape and scale parameters derived
from alpha1, alpha2, and prob.

\examples{
# Example 1: Generate data for 10 patients with 30\% DLT rate
# using Weibull distribution (default) and 28-day assessment window
set.seed(123)
data1 <- rtite(n = 10, prob = 0.30, maxt = 28)
data1$tox  # DLT indicators
data1$t_tox  # Time to DLT or censoring

# Example 2: Use uniform distribution
set.seed(123)
data2 <- rtite(n = 10, prob = 0.30, distribution = "uniform", maxt = 28)

# Example 3: Custom alpha1 and alpha2 parameters
# Assume 80\% of toxicity occurs in the last 30\% of assessment window
set.seed(123)
data3 <- rtite(
  n = 20,
  prob = 0.25,
  alpha1 = 0.8,
  alpha2 = 0.3,
  distribution = "weibull",
  maxt = 21
)

# Example 4: Compare distributions
set.seed(123)
n_sim <- 1000
data_weibull <- rtite(n_sim, prob = 0.30, distribution = "weibull", maxt = 28)
data_uniform <- rtite(n_sim, prob = 0.30, distribution = "uniform", maxt = 28)
data_loglogistic <- rtite(n_sim, prob = 0.30, distribution = "log-logistic", maxt = 28)

# Compare DLT rates (should all be close to 0.30)
mean(data_weibull$tox)
mean(data_uniform$tox)
mean(data_loglogistic$tox)
