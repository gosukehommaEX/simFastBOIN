\title{Isotonic Regression for Toxicity Rate Estimation}
\usage{
isotonic_regression(n_pts_mat, n_tox_mat, eliminated_mat, min_sample = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_pts_mat}{Matrix (n_trials x n_doses). Number of patients treated at each
dose level for each trial.}

\item{n_tox_mat}{Matrix (n_trials x n_doses). Number of DLTs at each dose level
for each trial.}

\item{eliminated_mat}{Logical matrix (n_trials x n_doses). Whether each dose has
been eliminated in each trial.}

\item{min_sample}{Numeric. Minimum number of patients required for a dose to be
considered for estimation. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
Matrix (n_trials x n_doses) of isotonic-adjusted toxicity rate estimates.
Values are NA for doses with insufficient sample size or eliminated doses.

\strong{Performance Note:} When no valid doses exist for a trial (i.e., all doses
have insufficient sample size or are eliminated), the function returns a row
of NA values without performing PAVA computations. This early exit optimization
significantly improves performance in scenarios where many trials terminate early
or have extensive dose elimination, avoiding unnecessary computational overhead.
}
\description{
Apply isotonic regression to estimate toxicity rates under the monotonicity
constraint (toxicity increases with dose) using the Pool Adjacent Violators
Algorithm (PAVA). This function processes multiple trials simultaneously for
efficient batch computation.
}
\details{
PAVA enforces the constraint that estimated toxicity rates are monotonically
increasing across doses. Pseudocounts (0.05 to DLT count, 0.1 to total patients)
are added before estimation, reflecting a Beta-Binomial conjugate prior.
Patient counts are weighted by inverse variance in PAVA to account for
estimation uncertainty.

This implementation leverages \code{Iso::pava()}, which is implemented in C
and highly optimized. While we loop over trials (unavoidable for PAVA), each
trial's computation uses the fast C implementation, resulting in significant
speedup compared to pure R PAVA implementations.

Key optimizations:
\itemize{
\item Use Iso::pava() (C implementation) instead of R loops
\item Pre-allocate all vectors to avoid repeated allocations
\item Vectorized pseudocount and variance calculations
\item Early exit for trials with no valid doses
}

The MTD selection is based on these isotonic-adjusted estimates, ensuring
that the dose-toxicity relationship respects the natural monotonicity assumption.
