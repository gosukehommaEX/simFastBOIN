\title{Batch Isotonic Regression for Multiple Trials (Internal)}
\usage{
.isotonic_regression_batch(n_pts_mat, n_tox_mat, eliminated_mat, min_sample)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_pts_mat}{Matrix (n_trials x n_doses). Number of patients treated at each
dose level for each trial.}

\item{n_tox_mat}{Matrix (n_trials x n_doses). Number of DLTs at each dose level
for each trial.}

\item{eliminated_mat}{Logical matrix (n_trials x n_doses). Whether each dose has
been eliminated in each trial.}

\item{min_sample}{Numeric. Minimum number of patients required for a dose to be
considered for estimation.}
}
\value{
Matrix (n_trials x n_doses) of isotonic-adjusted toxicity rate estimates.
Values are NA for doses with insufficient sample size or eliminated doses.
}
\description{
Apply isotonic regression to multiple trials simultaneously. This is an internal
function used by \code{sim_boin()} for efficient batch processing of simulation
results.
}
\details{
This function applies the same PAVA algorithm as \code{isotonic_regression()}
but processes multiple trials in a single function call. While there is still
a loop over trials internally, this approach is more efficient than calling
\code{isotonic_regression()} separately for each trial due to reduced function
call overhead and better memory locality.
